# RSA Encryption and RSA crack (GNFS partial)
An implementation of the RSA encryption scheme and the General Number Field Sieve partial algorithm to crack it.

The following contains :
-An implementation of the the RSA schema located in the RSA.ipynb file
-A partial implementation of one of currently known most efficient algorithm to crack the RSA encryption
(see GNFS.ipynb)

A french report on the complexity and limits of the algorithm is provided in french

This requires Jupyter Notebook.
